pytetgen
========

This is a python interface to tetgen, a powerful and fast mesh generator (http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/)

This package includes the tetgen source, v.1.5, and provides (so far) minimal bindings to be ables to generate 
meshes in python. The basic interface follows that of scipy.spatial.Delaunay. More bindings will come soon.

Basic Usage
===========

	>>> import pytetgen
	>>> import numpy as np
	>>> points = np.random.random(4*3).reshape(4,3)
	>>> tri = pytetgen.Delaunay(points)
	>>> np.sort(tri.simplices)
	array([[0, 1, 2, 3]], dtype=int32)


Comparison with `scipy.spatial.Delaunay()`

	"A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.[...]  However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version."

I guess the author would be glad if you cite him, if you use this wrapper.
